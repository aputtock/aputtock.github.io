        As a third-year electromechanic, I am passionate about promoting careers in the skilled trades and empowering others to explore this dynamic field. Through my outreach efforts, I aim to bridge the gap between education and opportunity, helping students understand the diverse career paths available to them within the trades.<br>
        
        Recently, I had the privilege of leading presentations at PATH Employment Agency in Hamilton, where I shared insights into the electromechanical trade and its potential for long-term career growth. These virtual sessions allowed me to reach a wider audience, showcasing the hands-on, technical nature of the work and the wide range of industries that rely on electromechanics. It was a rewarding experience to engage with individuals looking to explore new career options and offer guidance on navigating the path into this rewarding field.
        In addition, I have been working with students at Rosemont Vocational School, where I have provided mentorship and career advice to help them understand the practical skills and qualifications needed to succeed in the skilled trades. By highlighting the benefits of apprenticeships, certification programs, and the demand for skilled workers, I strive to inspire the next generation of tradespeople to pursue fulfilling careers.<br></p>
        
      <p class="pclass">My outreach work reflects my commitment to spreading awareness about the many opportunities available in the skilled trades and advocating for the value of hands-on learning in today’s workforce. I am proud to play a role in shaping the future of skilled trades professionals.<br></p>

      I successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive training program for a company of 150 employees, spanning several departments including website development and marketing, using Trainual. This initiative aimed to address the unique training needs of each department while maintaining overall consistency in the company’s skill-building efforts.<br>
      The first step was to identify the specific training requirements across different departments. I collaborated with department heads and conducted surveys with team members to pinpoint knowledge gaps and skill development opportunities. This assessment led to a clear understanding of the key focus areas for each department. For the website development team, the training focused on enhancing technical skills such as coding languages, version control systems, and the use of project management tools. For the marketing team, the training concentrated on areas like digital marketing strategies, SEO techniques, content creation, and analytics tools.

<h4 class="bitterh4">Creating Structured Training Modules</h4>

<p class="pclass">Using the insights from the needs assessment, I created a series of structured, interactive training modules on Trainual. These modules included lessons, quizzes, and checklists designed to engage employees and ensure knowledge retention. The content was tailored to the specific needs of each department, ensuring that both website developers and marketers had the tools they needed to excel in their roles. Topics covered included front-end and back-end development for the website team, along with key marketing strategies and tools for the marketing team.

<h4 class="bitterh4">Implementation and Progress Tracking</h4>

<p class="pclass">Once the training program was launched, I utilized Trainual’s tracking and analytics features to monitor employee progress. I set measurable goals, assigned deadlines, and tracked performance to ensure high engagement levels and effective knowledge transfer. This approach allowed me to identify areas where further support was needed and refine the program for continuous improvement. The result was a scalable and efficient training program that equipped employees with the necessary skills to succeed in their roles, while fostering company-wide consistency in learning.</p>
